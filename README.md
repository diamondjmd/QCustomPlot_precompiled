# QCustomPlot Library Precompiled
QCustomPlot Library precompiled with CMake. Honestly, I got so tired of watching paint dry while compiling this library for every project. 
So, I decided to save us all from the agony and precompile it. You're welcome!

## Important Tidbits
### CMakePresets.json
* You can ignore this file, like that one sock that always goes missing in the laundry. Or, you can use it to configure the project with CMake.
* You can set INSTALLATION_DIR to the directory where you want to install the library. Otherwise, it will be installed in the default directory, which is probably somewhere mysterious and hard to find.
